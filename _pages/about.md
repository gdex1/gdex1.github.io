I am a Research Scientist at LinkedIn, where I work on large-scale optimization for recommender systems and ads as well as LLM inference and training efficiency. I serve as the technical lead for the mathematical optimization pillar of our applied research team, where I designed and deployed a large-scale LP solver and coordinated cross-functional efforts to translate research into production systems.

I completed my PhD at Purdue University under the supervision of [Professor Petros Drineas](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/pdrineas/) and [Professor Rajiv Khanna](https://rjvak7.github.io/). My doctoral research centered on theoretical topics in optimization and randomized matrix algorithms with applications to machine learning.
