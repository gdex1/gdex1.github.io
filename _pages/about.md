I am a research scientist in the optimization team at LinkedIn, where I focus on reinforcement learning for recommender systems, optimization-based methods for compute resource allocation, and improving LLM inference efficiency.

I completed my PhD at Purdue University under the supervision of [Professor Petros Drineas](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/pdrineas/) and [Professor Rajiv Khanna](https://rjvak7.github.io/). My doctoral research centered on theoretical topics in optimization and randomized matrix algorithms with applications to machine learning.
